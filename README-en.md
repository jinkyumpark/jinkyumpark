# About me
<p align="center">  
  
  🙋‍♂️ Hi! I'm Jinkyum Park, a backend engineer who's committed to clean code.
  <br/><br/>

  - Working full-time as a backend engineer at [Viva Repulica (Toss)](https://toss.im/), a South Korean Fintech Startup valued at 10 billion USD.
  - Maintaining a strong commitment to Clean Code principles, I regularly refactor my code to ensure its maintainability and adhere to official documentation and established coding conventions. My dedication to well-structured project organization and clean code remains unwavering.
  - As a firm believer in the importance of a strong foundation, I actively pursue theoretical aspects of Computer Science, driven by my background in mathematics. 
  This passion leads me to engage in CS college courses available on YouTube and read books, even if they may not directly relate to my work.
  - Immersing myself in my work and achieving seemingly improbable goals drive my motivation, allowing me to consistently push boundaries and deliver exceptional outcomes.
