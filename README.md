# About me
<p align="center">  
  
  üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi! I'm a backend engineer who's commited to clean code
  <br/><br/>
  
  I am capable of developing MSA in Spring with decent understandings of underlying technologies like Java EE and Spring Framework Architecture.
  I have used Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Batch, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Config, Eureka, Hystrix in projects to name a few.
  <br/>
  
  I am serious about Clean Code. I refactor my code periodically and habitually checks official documents as well as good conventions for coding and project organizations.
  <br/>
  
  I am extremely interested in new technologies that can solve problems in a better way.
  I use new technologies like kotlin, spring webflux to refactor my old code.
  I am up-to-date with latest editions and refactor my code accordingly
  <br/>
  
  I value foundations and very much interested in theoratical aspects of Computer Science (maybe because I'm a math major)
  As such, I like to take CS college courses on YouTube and read books even when they are not directly related to my work.
  <br/>
  
  I have learned that writing test are absolutely crutial when it comes to software longevity.
  I try to write Unit Test and Integration Test zelously.
  <br/>
  
  I have experienced that good UIs and UXs are not only a decoration, 
  but also a core value to the product through good products like Apple, Viva Repulica(Toss, South Korean Fintech Startup), Woowa Bros(South Korean delivery service startup) to name a few.
  To learn from them, I always keep track of innovative tech companies through their conferences, blogs, and books.
  <br/>
  
  I am interested in productivity tips and tools.
  I learn shortcuts of every apps and website that I use often.
  I always think about how to automate repetivie tasks.
  <br/>
  
  I like to be immersed in what I am doing and achieve something that seems improbable.
  
</p>
